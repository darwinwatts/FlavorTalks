## 🌟 What is FlavorTalks
Flavor Talks is an innovative AI-powered culinary discovery platform that revolutionizes how people explore food through conversational storytelling. By combining advanced LLM narrative generation with intelligent taste profiling, the platform creates personalized dining experiences that go beyond traditional food apps.

Inspired by services like UberEats, DoorDash, Bite Sight and Qloo’s cultural taste intelligence, it helps users find personalized dining options through engaging storytelling.

Unlike conventional restaurant discovery apps, Flavor Talks transforms food exploration into an engaging conversation where AI understands your cravings, mood, dietary preferences, and cultural background to craft personalized culinary stories and recommendations.

Flavor Talks: "I love that cozy vibe! 🌧️ Are you thinking more along the lines of 
a hearty soup that wraps around you like a warm hug, or maybe some comfort food 
that brings back childhood memories? And what's your budget looking like tonight?"

User: "Something under $20, maybe Asian-inspired?"

Flavor Talks: "Perfect! I'm thinking about this incredible ramen shop nearby that 
serves steaming bowls of tonkotsu ramen - the broth is rich and creamy, simmered 
for 20 hours. There's something magical about the way the noodles dance in the 
golden broth while the soft-boiled egg adds that perfect creamy texture..."
